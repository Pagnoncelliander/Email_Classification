10. In this assessment, we explore a dataset containing 4601 rows and 59 columns, aiming to uncover insights while addressing common challenges such as missing values, data type inconsistencies.

The primary focus of this assessment is to process the dataset through key steps of Data Cleaning and Preparation and apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to optimize its usability for machine learning. By systematically cleaning and transforming the data, we ensure its integrity and prepare it for advanced analytical techniques.

Data Cleaning and Preparation: This involves resolving issues like missing or inconsistent data types, removing duplicate rows, and verifying the dataset's readiness. The importance of these steps lies in improving data reliability and eliminating noise that could hinder model performance.Principal Component Analysis (PCA): PCA is implemented to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while retaining its essential features. This step addresses the challenge of high-dimensional data by summarizing it into a manageable number of principal components.
